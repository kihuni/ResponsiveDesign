            <p>The Lorem ipum filling text is used by graphic designers, programmers and printers with the aim of
                occupying the spaces of a website, an advertising product or an editorial production whose final text is
                not yet ready.

                This expedient serves to get an idea of the finished product that will soon be printed or disseminated
                via digital channels.

                In order to have a result that is more in keeping with the final result, the graphic designers,
                designers or typographers report the Lorem ipsum text in respect of two fundamental aspects, namely
                readability and editorial requirements.</p>

            <p>The discovery was made by Richard McClintock , a professor of Latin at Hampden-Sydney College in
                Virginia, who faced the impetuous recurrence of the dark word consectetur in the text Lorem ipsum
                researched its origins to identify them in sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of the aforementioned Cicero's
                philosophical work.

                The words taken from one of the dialogues contained in the De finibus are therefore the pieces of the
                most famous nonsensical text in the world.</p>

                wave since 500, that is when, according to Professor Richard McClintock, its use spread among the
                printers of the time.</p>
